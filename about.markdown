The purpose of this website is to host content from my projects in an accessible way.

I am a PhD candidate in Industrial Ecology at the Leiden University Centre for Environmental Sciences (CML) where my research focuses on the use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to determine the environmental impacts of products and services.
