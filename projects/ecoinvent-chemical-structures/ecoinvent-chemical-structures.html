            <h2>Why, what, how?</h2>
            <p class="text">
              When building LCA inventories of chemical processes, it is sometimes necessary to use proxy chemicals to
              represent some
              of the inputs and outputs that cannot be found in the database. When this is the case, it is important to
              ensure that
              the proxy chemicals are as similar as possible to the real chemicals that they are replacing.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Usually, one would need to search on the internet to see the structures of the chemicals, which are
              sometimes listed in
              the database under non-systematic names that give no hint of the structure. This gets rather annoying and
              makes it
              easier to miss the best match or choose the wrong proxy.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              To make this process easier, I have processed the ecoinvent 3.10 database to extract the chemical abstract
              (CAS) numbers
              and (where possible) match each one to its structure. This allows one to do a quick visual scan through
              the
              structures
              to find the most appropriate proxy. Additional chemical information is also obtained, such as the SMILES
              string and the
              InChI code, formulas, and molecular weights and synonyms.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              The source code, data and images related to processing the database and collecting the structures is
              available on <a
                href="https://github.com/Stew-McD/brightway-scripts/tree/main/ecoinvent-chemical_structures">
                Github</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>The chemical structure gallery</h2>
            <p class="text">
              On this <a href="/projects/ecoinvent-chemical-structures/gallery-ecoinvent-chemical-structures.html"> page
              </a> you
              can find a gallery the images of the structures and their information, sorted by molecular weight.
              Click an image
              to find out more, including an embedded external search function for ecoinvent ecoquery and PubChem.

            </p>
            <p class="text">
              The images are in SVG format and are named `mW_CAS.svg`,
              where `mW` is the rounded molecular weight and `CAS` is the CAS number. Each image is annotated with
              the
              CAS number,
              ecoinvent name, IUPAC name, smiles string, formula and synonyms.

              Ideally, the SVG text should be
              searchable,
              so you can
              hit ctrl+f and search for whatever you are looking for and see the structure and other information
              instantly.
              (this is at the moment, due to some html mysteries, so you need to open the image in a separate tab to
              select text or search)
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Optimally, this
              presentation
              would be interactive somehow, with filtering and sorting
              options, but I don't have the time to do that right now. If you want to do it, feel free to fork
              the
              repo and
              make a pull request.
